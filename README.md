# deb11
Some deb-packages that aren't being maintained in Debian 11 (Bullseye).

Tuxguitar, for example, was extremely outdated and the project's hosted deb needed the java runtime dependency updated.
The packager/maintainer's email is dead, and I'm not jumping through hoops (upstream) for things you could learn on a forum.

I trust these files, because I got them or patched them; I'd recommend that YOU find a better source than a random git.

I'm just working on personal projects, like s GNU/Linux Debian XFCE distro, learning as I go.
